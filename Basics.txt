Testing is important to find the bugs at early stages.
Testing makes code safer to change.
We can make the automation easier.

Test case also acts as a documentation. It also forces you to write better code.


Types of TESTING :

1. Unit Testing - It means grabbing a small component in the app and testing it in isolation from any other component. The focus is the code still working if anysmall changes are made.
2. End to End (E2E) Testing - Testing entire flow of view or app according to the user point of view. It is often performed how the application changes when
                            an event is happening orr action is performed. e.g :-  when a button is pressed what element is added or changed.
3. Manual Tsting :- Manual Debugging.
4. Stress Testing :- Giving very stress to an application.
5. TDD - test driven development. First write the test and then develop your code.

KARMA - It is the Javascript test runner which is used to execute all the test and coverage reports. It has various great plugins.
JASMINE - It is a javascript testing framework, It is used to write the Test cases.
Protractor - It is created by the angular team, created using JASMINE framework and supports the End to End Testing.
Angular Mocks - It is a library which provides various Mocks.

JASMINE TUTORIAL

Suite - It is a collection of test cases that can be used to test a specific behavior of the JS code.
        It is made using the global function describe() which takes two parameters. First is the Suite name and second is the function that implements the
        test suite.

Spec :- It represents a test case inside the suite. This begins with a call to the Jasmine global function it() with two parameters. First is test case name
        and second is the function that implements a test case. A spec contains one or more expectations. Each expectation represents an assertion. If any one of the
        expectation fails, them the whole expectation fails.


module('testingAngularApp'); is include in each specs i.e in each test cases.

beforeEach(functionopt, timeoutopt) :- Run some shared setup before each of the specs in the describe in which it is called.
afterEach(functionopt, timeoutopt) :- Run some shared teardown after each of the specs in the describe in which it is called.

inject() :  Jasmine inject function uses dependency injection to resolve common services or providers, like $rootScope, $controller, 
            $q (promises mock), $httpBackend ($http mock), and match them to the corresponding parameters.

To test the compile and whol HTML we have to download the html2js-preprocessor. 
What it does is to convert html templates to JAvascript and then give it to karma for testing the actual HTML structure.

If you want to run a specific testcase we have to make the it() keyword as the fit() keyword.

******************************************************************************************

Test coverage :  Also called as the code coverage. It tells us how much our code has been tested. Its function is to check how much part of our code is
                been covered by unit tests and which have not . Full test coverage doesn't means 100% quality.
                
The code coverage can be seen throught the Framework known as the IStanbul which can be integrated with the Karma server.
Writing test for custom directive is little bit complicated . Hence practice a little.
We can do Mock for our own imaginative function just we did in writing the JUnits using the angular-mocks. We can mock using the $provide.
we can also do it using the Spies.
